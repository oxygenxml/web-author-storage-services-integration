Oxygen WebApp storage services integration
==========================================

This project is an integration of the oXygen Web Author with two of the most popular online file storage services: Google Drive and Dropbox.

**If you are developing a Web Author plugin and looking for some inspiration, it is better to look at the other [WebDAV](https://github.com/oxygenxml/web-author-webdav-plugin) and [GitHub](https://github.com/oxygenxml/web-author-github-plugin) plugins.**
